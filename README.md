## Bot(s) Description(s)
### Cockroach Moe
Farms all relevant endgame items up to Ultra Boss requirements, with the option to prefarm Archmage to speed it up later.
**Notes:** 
1. The bot expects you to have Dragon of Time, ArchPaladin, and Blade of Awe. The bot may not work properly without them.
2. The bot takes up a lot of inventory space due to hoarding items to speed up later farms, make sure to empty your inventory first. (Will be fixed later)

Farming route:
(DOT,AP,BoA) -> BloD -> LR -> (VHL) -> (AM 1, 2) -> Lacerate -> Smite -> (AM 2,3) -> Praxis -> Val -> (AM2), ADK -> VDK -> Awescended ->  Helm ->(AM 5, 6) -> Cape Ench -> Elysium -> Ultra Prereqs -> AM -> NSoD

Items in brackets "()" are optional choices you can choose to farm or not. The reason they are optional is as of writing this, both VHL and Archmage are *not necessary* for endgame like Ultra Bosses.
